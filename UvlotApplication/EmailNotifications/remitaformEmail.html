        <p>Your application for a Payroll loan from CashNowNow is in the final stage of processing.  However, in order to disburse the funds we require you to activate a standing order with your bank.  This standing order will be used to automatically deduct your monthly payment during the period of the loan.  See summary details below;</p>
       <p> Loan Amount:&#8358;$LoanAmount<br />
           Loan Tenure: $LoanTenure months<br />
           Monthly Repayment Amount: &#8358;$RepaymentAmt<br />

</p>
        <p>
        <p>
            Loan Amount:&#8358;$LoanAmount<br />
        <p>
            Loan Amount:&#8358;$LoanAmount<br />
            Note: The amount on the REMITA standing order (see link below) includes an additional monthly payment amount of &#8358;$RepaymentAmt.  The company will only deduct this from this amount if the loan is in default (see terms and conditions for more details)
        </p>
            <p>To complete the process, please click on the button below to view the prefilled standing order.</p>

            <p>Funds will be disbursed within 24 hours of the activation.  If you have any further questions please contact customercare@uvlot.com or contact us via telephone or WhatsApp at 0907 333 3484 or 0901 424 2062</p>
